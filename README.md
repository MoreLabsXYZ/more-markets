# MORE-markets


MORE Protocol Overview
MORE is an innovative non-custodial lending protocol designed to provide robust infrastructure for decentralized asset management. It consists of two interconnected components: MORE Markets and MORE Optimizers, each serving distinct but complementary roles.

MORE Markets: This is the foundational lending protocol, developed as a fork of Morpho and deployed on the Flow blockchain.
MORE Optimizers: Building on Morpho Vaults, MORE Optimizers extend functionality by enabling curators to supply, borrow, and strategically deploy assets across multiple MORE or Morpho markets on Ethereum and Flow.
Enhanced Curation Capabilities
Morpho currently allows curators to accept deposits from passive lenders and allocate funds across multiple markets within a vault. MORE takes this a step further, offering an expanded feature set that empowers curators with comprehensive asset management tools.
